# About

A simple application that can store a user's grades for all their courses, calculate average grade (course points adjusted), and show best/worst grades. Has support for exporting information as .csv.

The information is stored based on user chosen username, so the used username needs to be remembered to easily access previosuly entered information.

The UI is very simple, but functional, powered by javaFX.

This project was my first introduction to Java programming.
